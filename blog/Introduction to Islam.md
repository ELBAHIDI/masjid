## What is Islam?
Islam is a complete way of life that emphasizes peace, submission to Allah (God), and mercy to all creation. The word "Islam" itself means "submission to the will of Allah" and comes from the Arabic root word meaning "peace."

## The Five Pillars of Islam

### 1. Shahada (Declaration of Faith)
The testimony that "There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah" (La ilaha illa Allah, Muhammad rasul Allah).

### 2. Salah (Prayer)
Muslims perform five daily prayers:
- Fajr (Dawn prayer)
- Dhuhr (Noon prayer)
- Asr (Afternoon prayer)
- Maghrib (Sunset prayer)
- Isha (Night prayer)

### 3. Zakat (Charity)
Annual charity giving 2.5% of one's wealth to those in need, purifying both wealth and heart.

### 4. Sawm (Fasting)
Fasting during the month of Ramadan from dawn to sunset, teaching self-discipline and empathy.

### 5. Hajj (Pilgrimage)
Pilgrimage to Mecca once in a lifetime for those who are physically and financially able.

## Core Beliefs

### 1. Belief in One God (Tawheed)
Islam teaches pure monotheism - belief in one God, Allah, who has no partners or equals.

### 2. Belief in Angels
Angels are Allah's creation who carry out His commands and never disobey Him.

### 3. Belief in Divine Books
Including:

### 4. Belief in Prophets
All prophets from Adam to Muhammad (peace be upon them all) brought the same message of monotheism.

### 5. Belief in the Day of Judgment
A day when all souls will be held accountable for their deeds.
